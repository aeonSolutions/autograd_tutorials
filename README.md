# How to use autograd's flatten_func

This repo contains a short Jupyter notebook describing how to use [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd)'s [flatten_func](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/blob/master/autograd/misc/flatten.py), and what it does.

This notebook was produced as supplementary material for the second edition of the textbook Machine Learning Refined, published Cambridge University Press, which is set to release mid-2019.  You can find a host of examples employing `autograd` and - in particular - `flatten_func` on the main repository for the textbook [located here](https://github.com/jermwatt/mlrefined) (see for example the drafts on [multi-class classification](https://jermwatt.github.io/mlrefined/blog_posts/7_Linear_multiclass_classification/7_2_Perceptron.html) [fully connected networks](https://jermwatt.github.io/mlrefined/blog_posts/13_Multilayer_perceptrons/13_1_Multi_layer_perceptrons.html)).
